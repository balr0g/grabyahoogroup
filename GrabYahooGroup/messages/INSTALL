The script is a standalone script but it requires the following perl modules to
be installed on your machine.

HTTP::Request::Common
HTTP::Cookies
LWP::UserAgent
LWP::Simple
HTML::Entities

CPAN module installation being out of the scope of this document I would
recommend you visit http://www.cpan.org to know more.

WARNING: Perl version > 5.6.0 are unicode aware and can cause problems handling
binary data. Binary data includes all zip files and image files downloaded using
this script. Please read perldoc perlunicode for more details.
In RedHat 8.0 and RedHat 9.0 I have circumvented the problem by setting the 
environment variable LANG to en_US. Setting this system wide might not be acceptable
therefore I would recommend running the script as 

env LANG=en_US yahoo2maildir.pl <group name>
