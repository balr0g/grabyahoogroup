[MANDATORY] group to download

The script will output a tab separated file with as much data as it can extract
If there is any data which is visible on the web and not in the output please
contact the author.
Note: You can save the output as a .xls file and MS Excel will pick it up
correctly.

------------------------
[AVAILABLE OPTIONS]
verbose => default off - says what the script is doing
getadult => default on - get details even from adult groups
username => your yahoo userid
password => yahoo password
http_proxy => HTTP proxy in http://hostname:port/ format
timeout => connection time out for HTTP requests
user_agent => browser being used - Changing this value is probably unethical at
              the least and possible illegal at the worst

------------------------
[EXAMPLE]

Normal run : ./yahoogroups_members.pl <group name>

Debug run : ./yahoogroups_members.pl --verbose=1 <group name>
