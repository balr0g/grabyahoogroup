Inspired by Ravi Ramkissoon's fetchyahoo utility.
[http://fetchyahoo.twizzler.org/]
and by  Vadim Zeitlin's yahoo2mbox utility.
[http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~zeitlin/yahoo2mbox.html]

The basic mechanism for logging on to Yahoo has been taken from fetchyahoo and
email address unmangling has been taken from yahoo2mbox.

Needs atleast one parameter : the group to be downloaded.
You can also provide the begin and end message id to download.

If you dont want to keep a file yet skip its download make it a zero byte file

The program will create a directory in the current directory for every group
it downloads. Each message id will be a separate file in that folder.

By default the tool will run in quite mode assuming the user wants to run it
in batchmode. Set a environment variable DEBUG to a true value to run in
verboose mode.

# Mandatory : group to download
# Optional : begining message id and ending message id.

------------------------

To run : yahoo2maildir.pl <group name> [<begin message id> [<end message id>]]

Quite mode : env VERBOSE=0 yahoo2maildir.pl <group name> [<begin message id> [<end message id>]]

Verbose mode with unicode support turned off : env VERBOSE=0 LANG=en_US yahoo2maildir.pl <group name> [<begin message id> [<end message id>]]
