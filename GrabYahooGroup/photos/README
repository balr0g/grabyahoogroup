Inspired by Ravi Ramkissoon's fetchyahoo utility.
[http://fetchyahoo.sourceforge.net/]

The basic mechanism for logging on to Yahoo has been taken from fetchyahoo.

Needs atleast one parameter : the group to be downloaded.

If you don't want to keep a file yet skip its download make it a zero byte file

The script will create a directory in the current directory for every group
it downloads. Inside this folder the complete hierarchy will be replicated as
present on Yahoo.

By default the tool will run in verbose mode assuming the user wants to run it
in batch mode. Set a environment variable DEBUG to a true value to run in
verbose mode.

# Mandatory : group to download

------------------------

To run : ./yahoogroups_photos.pl <group name>

Quite mode : env VERBOSE=0 ./yahoogroups_photos.pl <group name>

Quite mode with unicode support turned off : env VERBOSE=0 LANG=en_US ./yahoogroups_photos.pl <group name>
