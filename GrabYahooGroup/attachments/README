Inspired by Ravi Ramkissoon's fetchyahoo utility.
[http://fetchyahoo.sourceforge.net/]
The basic mechanism for logging on to Yahoo has been taken from his program.

Needs atleast one parameter : the group to be downloaded.
You can also provide the begin and end message id to download.

If you dont want to keep a file yet skip its download make it a zero byte file

The program will create a directory in the current directory for every group
it downloads. Each message id will have a separate directory and the
attachments will be named as provided by the poster. It sanitizes the
filename by throwing out all the non word characters excluding "." from the
filename.

By default the tool will run in verbose mode assuming the user wants to run it
in batch mode. Set a environment variable VERBOSE to a true value to run in
verbose mode.

# Mandatory : group to download
# Optional : begining message id and ending message id.

Note: RedHat 8.0/9.0 by default assume every file including temporary files to
      be UTF-8 encoded. Change the environment variable LANG to a non UTF-8 value.

------------------------

To run : yahoogroups.pl <group name> [<begin message id> [<end message id>]]

Quite mode : env VERBOSE=0 yahoogroups.pl <group name> [<begin message id> [<end message id>]]

Verbose mode with unicode support turned off : env VERBOSE=0 LANG=en_US yahoogroups.pl <group name> [<begin message id> [<end message id>]]
