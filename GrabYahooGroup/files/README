The script will create a directory in the current directory for every group
it downloads. Inside this folder the complete hierarchy will be replicated as
present on Yahoo.

[MANDATORY] group to download

If you don't want to keep a file yet skip its download make it a zero byte file

By default the tool will run in verbose mode assuming the user wants to run it
in batch mode.

------------------------
[AVAILABLE OPTIONS]
verbose => default on - says what the script is doing
getadult => default on - get details even from adult groups
cookie_save => default on - save the user details via cookie
cookie_load => default on - load the cookies saved in a previous session
username => your yahoo userid
password => yahoo password
http_proxy => HTTP proxy in http://hostname:port/ format
timeout => connection time out for HTTP requests
user_agent => browser being used - Changing this value is probably unethical at
              the least and possible illegal at the worst

------------------------
