The script is a standalone script but it requires the following perl modules to
be installed on your machine.

Crypt::SSLeay
HTTP::Request::Common
HTTP::Cookies
LWP::UserAgent
LWP::Simple
HTML::Entities

CPAN module installation being out of the scope of this document I would
recommend you visit http://www.cpan.org to know more.

                             -- WINDOWS --
You need to have a perl installation on your OS - Windows has two common options
ActivePerl and Cygwin. CPAN installations would work on the cygwin installation
assuming you are comfortable with it. Otherwise ActivePerl distributes binary
releases available through their ppm tool.

Crypt::SSLeay doesnt come in as default in ActivePerl visit their website for more
details as to how to install it using ppm.
                               -- UNIX --
WARNING: Perl version > 5.6.0 are unicode aware and can cause problems handling
binary data. Binary data includes all zip files and image files downloaded using
this script. Please read perldoc perlunicode for more details.
In RedHat 8.0 and RedHat 9.0 I have circumvented the problem by setting the 
environment variable LANG to en_US. Setting this system wide might not be acceptable
therefore I would recommend running the script as 

env LANG=en_US yahoo2maildir.pl <group name>
